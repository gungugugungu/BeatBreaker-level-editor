# What's this?
This is a level editor software created for my *upcoming* game **BeatBreaker** for the Playdate. 

# How to use?
## Bottom panel buttons
### Play button
The play button start the song from the start point you set.
### Stop button
The stop button stops the song. (not pausing)
### Add button
The add button adds a new block, and opens the menu to set it's parameters.
## Side panel
The side panel displays the list of blocks in the song, sorted by their start times. If you click on any block it'll start editing it and if you click the delete button you'll delete it. Be aware, there is **no undo** button so measure twice, cut once.
